            <h2>Marketing The Mummy</h2>
            <p>The two main ideals around the marketing for the movie The Mummy were to advertise and generate publicity.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To advertise, they created tv adverts and posters alongside releasing merchandise. The posters highlighted the ancient Egyptian themes, showcasing the mummy and the adventurous tone without revealing too much of the movie to intrigue viewers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For the TV adverts, they focused on more dramatic and romantic shots from the movie to target specific demographics. Special effects, such as the sandstorm, were prominently featured to showcase its visual appeal.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Universal Pictures also distributed t-shirts as a part of promotional giveaways. These were often handed out at special events, radio contests, and early screenings. The shirts featured iconic visuals, like the film’s logo, the "face in the sandstorm" design, or images of Imhotep, instantly recognizable symbols tied to the movie.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The movie’s target audience was 12 to 24-year-olds. Due to this, the trailer is designed as an action-packed experience to keep viewers engaged and intrigued. The film's romantic elements appeal to women, while its action and adventure aspects cater to men.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Modern movie marketing employs tactics that are dramatically different from those used in the past. These changes are driven by advancements in technology, evolving consumer behaviour, and the increasing dominance of digital platforms. In modern times, marketing tactics typically revolve around social media adverts and word of mouth, compared to traditional posters and tv adverts.</p>

            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <p>For my project, I decided to do the <b>Shaun of The Dead</b> trailer as it is a movie I thoroughly enjoy. I chose a section from the trailer with a lot of sound effects, as most of the trailer only has dialogue.</p>
